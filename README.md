### Overview and Origin
Chime is a FinTech company founded in 2013 by Chris Britt and Ryan King. The company is based out of San Francisco, CA. Britt serves as the Chief Executive Officer, while King carries out the Chief Technology Officer duties. They both believed that basic banking services should be helpful, easy, and free. They also wanted to provide banking services to those who lacked access or are underserved in the traditional model. The company has received [$2.6B in funding] thus far from 29 investors over 10 funding rounds. There are also [reports from Forbes] that the company plans to go public in March 2022 at a valuation of $35-45B, however, the company has so far declined to comment on this specific timeline. CEO Chris Bratt has [previously said], "We're not in a rush to go public to capture a valuation just because all the indexes are up and companies are trading at a high multiple."

### Business Activities:
The traditional banking system has been in place for many centuries, with historical records showing that banking was used in Acient Greece, Rome, Egypt, and Babylon. According to [Investopedia], Temples were often used as a place to store valuables, as they were protected by preists, devout individuals, and even armed guards. As the world grew and empires expanded, so did banks and the banking model. In today's global economy, the banking system may look a lot different from ancient times, but the basic principles and foundations of the financial systems have remained the same. At least until 2013. 

Enter Chime. Chime is a new type of banking that exists entirely online, with no physical branches or ATMs. They also provide banking services without having a banking license themselves. They get around this by partnering with Regional and Local banks to offer checking accounts, savings accounts, and credit cards to customers across the United States. 

Per their [mission statement], they believe that everyone deserves financial peace of mind.

When people today think of traditional banks, the phrase "nickle-and-dime" often comes to mind. Banks have traditionally taken advantage of a large assortment of fees to add to to their bottom line, including but not limited to overdraft fees, monthly service fees, ATM withdrawl fees, and account closing fees. In fact, large banks in America with assets of at least $1B took in $11.68B in overdraft fees in 2019 according to [research] by Center for Responsible Lending. Chime is attempting to solve this problem by earning their revenue through interchange fees, the fee that Visa charges a merchant to process a transaction. Chime is then paid a portion of that fee.

Chime's intended customer is lower or middle class and might not have current access to banking services. This could be because they are younger and just entering adulthood, or because they live in an area that reliable banking is harder to come by. Diving into the $11.68B in overdraft fees mentioned in the previous paragraph, 84% of those were paid by just 9% of the account holders charged. Poverty is often a tough cycle to climb out of, especially when your access to banks and the financial system is non-existent of you are being penalized further for not having enough money. Chime does not charge sign-up fees, overdraft fees, monthly service fees,  minimum balance fees, transaction fees, or card replacement fees. This is a game changer for consumers, and is possible because of their lower overhead costs due to not having any physical branches. 

They also seem to be more popular with younger customers such as those who have just recently graduated from university and might not have traditional banking accounts already. In 2018, [they acquired Pinch], a company that makes it easier for customers to raise their credit score just by paying their rent. Typically, younger consumers may not own a home yet and also are in the starting stages of building up their credit score for use later in life. This acquisition seems to be trying to bolster Chime's reputation with Millenials, who at the time of the acquisition made up 90% of Chime's userbase. This is an exciting usergroup statistic considering that Millenials make up around 30% of the American population and have a combined spending power of $1.4T in 2020. 

Chime currently uses many different technologies to create their final product. According to [StackShare], Chimes uses a variety of tools including:

 - 17 applications
 - 6 utilities
 - 17 DevOps
 - 3 Business Tools. 

They are also gaining an advantage over traditional banking providers by using AI to improve their design and marketing potential. They are focused on using AI to help predict what types of messaging will catch their target consumer's attention.

As [Guy Yalif] writes on the [The Financial Brand][df1]

This is no small feat, and is a clear indication that the use of AI will clearly make companies like Chime more competitive.

### Landscape:
Chime falls under the FinTech domain of Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking. This domain is relatively new but has already been going through major changes and innovations. While there have been many new players such as Chime, Cash App, Venmo, Ally, and SoFi, traditional banks are quickly addapting to try to keep pace. Banks such as Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America have created their own applications and websites in an attempt to compete in online banking. Now we will examine some of the major changes and trends in this FinTech domain.  

The first major trend is that technology is improving rapidly and consumers are more connected than ever to the internet through a variety of means. Depositing a check, for example, used to require a customer to drive to a bank and complete the process in-person. Now, with a majority of the population having access to a smart phone with high-speed internet connection, one only needs to take a picture of the check and is able to deposit it online through their bank's mobile application. 

Consumers also have better access to personal finance tools that help them build a strong portfolio and learn how to better manage their finances. Mobile applications allow for user's to not only view their balances, but help guide them with savings, budgeting, and more. Chime, for example, offers services that automatically puts 10% of your direct deposit into a Savings account, or rounds up and purchases to the next dollar, while also putting the difference into Savings. Services like these help customers who might not have a lot of knowledge in personal finance by making the process easy and automatic. One no longer needs to think about saving money, it just happens. This is a far cry from decades ago, where you would need to again, drive to a bank, sit down with a personal banker to review statements and create a budget, and then continuously track expenses through keeping good records in your checkbook or reviewing receipts.

A third trend that has helped this new FinTech domain is the decreasing costs of doing business. With cloud services like AWS, companies no longer have as large of an up-front cost when first starting up. Continuing operations also cost less due to lower computing and data costs. 

Another major event that happened in the industry was the COVID-19 pandemic. With more people and workers than ever having to carry out their lives remotely, this has also spilled over into the financial industry. Lockdowns and remote work have pushed more people than ever to using online services for everyday tasks, such as banking and shopping. 

### Results
Although Chime has only been in business since 2013, the quick success of the company is being felt by Big Banks and traditional financial players. Some core metrics that banks use to measure success include revenue, total transaction volume, and total number of accounts. Chime has tripled their transaction volume and revenue in 2020 and is currently signing up hundreds of thousands of new users every month. This is partly due to the large amount of effort that Chime spends on marketing. For example, Chime [spent $32 million] on TV ads during the first eight months of 2019—$48 million on annualized basis. They also signed a multi-year deal with Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association for the Jersey Patch sponsorship on Mavericks jerseys. Although the details of the deal weren't released, this can cost from $2M to $20M per year depending on the market. 

**Chime Users**
| Year | Number of users |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2017 | 0.5 million |
| 2018 | 1 million |
| 2019 | 5 million |
| 2020 | 10 million |
| 2021 | 12 million |

The number of Chime Users has continued to grow quickly, which is having a large impact on the revenue and valuation of the company. [Businessofapps.com] has estimated Chime's 2021 valuation at $25B, similar to companies such as Best Buy, Southwest Airlines, and Hormel Foods. Compared to competitors, Chime is considered one of the most popluar online FinTech banking services in the United States.

### Recommendations
Chime is doing a great job with their current business model, as shown by their financial success and valuation. However, there are three main actions that the company can take to improve and expand. 

First, I believe they need to offer more financial services. Currently, they offer savings, checkings, and a credit card option. While this is a great start for customers that have previously been unbanked, I believe it will become harder to attract new customers in the future if they don't offer a larger variety of services. New services could include investment options, cryptocurrencies, and mortgages or personal loans. Technologies that could be used in this space would be Blockchain and DeFi apps to help with the crypto business and loans.  

The second course of action that Chime can take to improve their bottom line is to attract high-income earners who might already be using the traditional banking model. These customers as a whole spend more money, which would lead to more interchange fees to help grow Chime's revenue. If Chime follows my first recommendation, I think that would help attract more of the higher-income market. 

My final recommendation would be to offer a charity or giving option. Millenials, which make up the largest percentage of Chime's userbase, are known to care deeply about causes and helping others. If there was an option to give a certain amount of your direct deposit or percentage of each payment to a charity of your choice, I think this could be a good hook to get new user's attention. The positive PR generated by this would be useful in marketing efforts as well.
